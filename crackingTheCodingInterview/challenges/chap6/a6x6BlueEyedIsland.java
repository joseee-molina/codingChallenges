     * There are brown eyed and blue eyed people in the island,
     * brown eyed people cannot tell them that they are blue eyed,
     * how much time before all of them elave the island?
     *
     * The extreme case is 1 person has blue eyes only. So, that person
     * looks around and realize that he is the only one, so he goes
     *  to the plane and leaves in the first day.
     *
     *  If two peopla have blue eyes, they see each other but in their minds
     *  they see only one blue eyed. so they wait to the second day and see that
     *  the other has not left, so they leave the island.
     *
     *  If there are 3, they know that there are 2 or 3 people with blue eyes,
     *  if there are 2 then they just leave in the second day, but if they dont
     *  then there are 3.
