     * The objective here is to get a random node from
     * a binary tree. What I can do is:
     * 1. Choose a random number between 0 and the size
     * of the tree.
     * 2. Traverse the tree until that number gets to 0.
     * 3. Return that node.
     *  Time complexity: O(N)
     *  Space complexity: O(1)
