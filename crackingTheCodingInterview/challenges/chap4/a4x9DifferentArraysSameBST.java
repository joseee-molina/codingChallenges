     * Sorry for not posting yesterday! It was a difficult day for me,
     * I had some problem here in the family but we're all good thankfully.
     * Or at least i think so. Well, going back to the problem, how to get
     * all the possible arrays that read from left to right give you some
     * binary search tree? The idea is in the levels, as long as you take
     * numbers from the same levels, you can shuffle them as you wish,
     * and the outputted bst will be the same
