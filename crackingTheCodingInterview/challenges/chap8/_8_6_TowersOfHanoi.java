    /*
    Given N disks and 3 towers (stacks), the disks can slide into any tower. The disks
    cannot be placed under smaller ones, and that is the rule. Please transport them into another tower.

    After playng for a while, there are some details I would like to talk about.
    The base case is when we have only one disk, then we just move it. When we have two disks, then we move
    one to tower 3 then the other t 2 then the 3 to 2.
    And the process is similar for all of the others, it is just that we need to solve it
    recursively
