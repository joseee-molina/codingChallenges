     I would have directories, and those directories can be in a Hashmap, where the original directory has
     some directories inside it, and you can create more of them. In other words, the Hashmaps have names and those
     point to other hashmaps (directories).

     In order to get an absolute and a relative path, we can use an iterative approach and start with a /, then
     whenever we go deeper into the hashmaps, we add another / followed by the name of the directory
